# A Rust Linked List 

This library contains a simple Rust implementation of: 

- a linked list;
- a polymorphic linked list;

Furthermore, if you run the file, you will see that the executable runs a small
example that shows how the functions work. 

## How to build 

You can simply build it like you would any other project with: 

```bash
cargo run
# or 
cargo build && ./target/debug/linked_list_example
# or if you are nix inclined
nix-build
```

## But why?

The first thing I wanted to create when I got into Rust was a linked list. I
remember at the time being unable to do so, and then asking loads of people -
with the answer not actually being given. But the time has come, and I was able
to bash this out, so I thought - why not - let's put it on github.


## Anything else?

No, that's it. 

Bye.
